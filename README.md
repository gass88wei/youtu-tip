Tip is a proactive on-device AI assistant that intelligently understands your current work. As a more user-friendly extension of [Youtu-Agent](https://github.com/TencentCloudADP/Youtu-agent), Tip integrates desktop automation, agent invocation, and more. It is fully open source, supports offline on-device use, and keeps your privacy secure.

Tip is powered by a series of self-developed lightweight models:
- Youtu-LLM: A compact 1.96B model with powerful native agent capabilities.
  > [🤗 Model](https://huggingface.co/collections/tencent/youtu) | [📑 Technical Report](youtu-llm/assets/Youtu-LLM_Technical_Report.pdf) | [🚀 Quick Start Guide](youtu-llm/README.md)
- Youtu-VL: 4B on-device multimodal large model, comprehensive visual perception capability (soon to be open source)

You are also free to swap out the model for any alternative you prefer.

## What is Tip

### Tip’s core traits

Tip focuses on “better interaction, safer privacy, broader capability”:

- **One hotkey, as the AI super entry**: With minimal interaction, you get the model’s power. Press the hotkey and select text or an image—Tip prepares the context for you. We are building a smarter Spotlight-style entry for a smoother AI experience.
- **On-device models for full privacy**: We support fully offline calls to local model services. All data and processing can run against your own on-device models. The Youtu-LLM series provides strong performance and agent ability for secure local work.
- **Read files, browse pages—no problem**: GUI Agent and Youtu Agent capabilities let Tip simulate mouse/keyboard actions for desktop control, connect to agents/MCP servers/tools for complex tasks, and run a multifunction agent locally.

### Why Tip was built

- **Data and privacy safety**: Many LLM agent apps default to processing data in the cloud. For privacy-sensitive scenarios like social platforms, users may not want screen content sent to cloud models and instead prefer private on-device solutions.
- **The last mile of interaction**: LLM apps usually start with a chat box and require typing. We want a smarter way to complete context: no manual typing, copy/paste, or image uploads—Tip understands what is on screen, completes context, infers intent, and suggests actions to reduce typing and close the interaction gap.
- **On-device agent environment**: Most agents live in the cloud, making it hard to run local tasks like “understand and organize local files” or “check chats on a social platform.” We aim to provide a mature framework and environment so users can run a more capable agent locally.


## How to use Tip

### Installer

We provide a download link: [Download link](github release)  
> Tip currently supports MacOS devices with Apple Silicon (M-series). More device types are being adapted and packaged quickly.

After downloading, grant the required permissions:
- On first launch, enable screen recording and accessibility permissions so shortcuts and screenshots work correctly.  
  > If Tip is not listed, click the + button, locate Tip, and add it. Permission scope: accessibility is used only to read current selection and simulate keyboard/mouse; screen and audio capture are used only for region screenshots.
- Press `ctrl + shift` to activate Tip and start using it.

<p align="center"><img src="youtu-tip/docs/assets/doc_privacy_en.png" alt="Permissions screenshot" width="720"></p>


### Quick start

Tip comes with Tip Cloud free credits by default, deployed on our platform endpoint. In “Settings - Models” you can add more models, including on-device offline models (Ollama) or OpenAI SDK-compatible endpoints (local or remote).

Three quick ways to invoke Tip:
- Press `ctrl + shift` to open the chat window and talk directly.
- Select some text, then press `ctrl + shift`; Tip will pick up the selection and continue the dialog with that context.
- Hold `ctrl + shift` to enter screenshot mode: while holding, drag to select a region; release to let Tip read the selected image area and continue the conversation.


## More Tip tricks

### GUI skills

We provide Claude-style “skills”: you can teach the model how to operate the computer and let it remember those actions for future use. For example, teach “find the cheapest flights”: open the site, click “sale flights,” then sort by price.

Add more skills under “Settings - GUI Agent” to help Tip operate the desktop more effectively.


### Youtu Agent

Tip integrates [Youtu Agent](https://github.com/TencentCloudADP/Youtu-agent) to give the model more abilities. In “Settings - Youtu Agent,” switch to a config file. Two demo configs are available: “File manager” (bash/file management) and “File manager plus” (adds some format-parsing ability).

When selecting a file, use “Right click - Open with - Tip” so Tip gets the file path. Click “Agent Execute” to have Tip interpret the file contents.


### Connect on-device models

Our on-device model service supports two entry points:

#### Use the Ollama endpoint

Install and start Ollama, pull, and run a local model:

1. Download: visit ollama.com and click “Download macOS.”
2. Unzip the file, drag `Ollama.app` into Applications, run it, and finish setup (Next -> Install).
3. Open Terminal and run: `ollama serve`
4. Open another Terminal window and run: `ollama pull <model-name>`

Once running, connect Tip:

1. In “Settings - Models,” click Add.
2. In “Channel,” choose “ollama” and enter the model name.
3. Save, then connect it in “Settings - General.”

Our Youtu-LLM on-device models are applying for official Ollama endpoints and will be downloadable soon.


#### Use the OpenAI endpoint

We also support the standard OpenAI SDK entry. You can use any online provider or local services like `llama-server`.

1. In “Settings - Models,” click Add.
2. In “Channel,” choose “OpenAI SDK” and fill in `base_url`, `api_key`, `model`, etc.
3. Save, then connect it in “Settings - General.”


## Local development

The full source code and architecture are open. You can develop and package locally to customize any feature. See: [README](youtu-tip/README.md)

## Youtu-LLM: Small and powerful

We proudly introduce Youtu-LLM: a compact yet powerful LLM with 1.96B parameters, 128K context, and native agent ability. In general evaluations, Youtu-LLM significantly outperforms peers of similar size in commonsense, STEM, coding, and long-context tasks. In agent benchmarks, Youtu-LLM surpasses larger models and completes multiple end-to-end agent tasks.


### Highlights

Youtu-LLM’s main contributions:
- **Designed for STEM capability**: vocabulary, data mix, and multi-stage curriculum center on STEM and agent performance.
- **Native agent ability**: trained with 128K context plus Agentic Mid-training to enable more rounds of interaction on-device.
- **SOTA performance**: based on a dense MLA architecture, Youtu-LLM achieves SOTA results on lightweight LLMs, outperforming traditional dense GQA/MHA. MLA also makes integration into DSV3-oriented ecosystems straightforward.


## Performance comparison

We provide Base and Instruct models with strong results across benchmarks, plus evaluation code to reproduce scores. See [README](youtu-llm/README.md) for details.

## Using Youtu-LLM

Usage:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("tencent/Youtu-LLM-2B", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "tencent/Youtu-LLM-2B",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
```

We provide a quick start covering “inference with transformers,” “configure thinking mode,” “tune decoding params,” and “deploy with vLLM and tool use.” See: [README](youtu-llm/README.md)
